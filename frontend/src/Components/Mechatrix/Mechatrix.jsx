          Mechatrix is the Annual technical week or the Branch fest of the ME
          Department organised by the Mechanical Engineering Society. With
          various events incorporating interest and scientific temperament among
          the students, Mechatrix is a rollercoaster of interesting and
          mind-boggling events that make for an enthralling and exuberant week.
          With 8 editions having been successfully completed, we look forward to
          organising Mechatrix 9.0 in 2022.
